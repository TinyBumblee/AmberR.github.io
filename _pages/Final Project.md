<strong>Cybersecurity in Healthcare: Protecting Patient Data</strong>

This project focuses on helping healthcare workers and students understand how important it is to keep patient information safe and follow HIPAA guidelines. It explains some of the biggest cybersecurity risks in healthcare—like phishing scams, ransomware, and insider mistakes—and shares simple ways to prevent them. My goal with this poster was to make cybersecurity feel approachable by showing how everyday habits, such as using strong passwords and locking devices, can protect both patients and their trust. The poster is meant for anyone who handles patient data, whether in a clinic, hospital, or classroom setting.
